//look at this code like a pointer review...

#include <msp430.h> // this is the header file that contains info fo the microcontroller we will
//be using.

#define _REG1 (0x4000)
sfrw _REG1 = _REG1; //assembly code that does the same as the #define above

void main(void) {
	
//note that in C programming, all integers must be initialized at the very beginning of the main/function
	unsigned int i = 25;
	unsigned int* volatile MyPtr = (unsigned int*) 0x4000;

	i = (unsigned int) MyPtr;
	*MyPtr = i; 
	MyPtr = &i; //this gives the address location of where I is

//also note that in a loop, the value used must already be predefined and existing. 
//thus, the value exists throughout the code, not just in the loop...

/*
Example: 
	for (i=0 ; i<3; i++) //notice how i is not defined...it must be predefined before use at the 
				//beginning of the function/code.
		A[i];
