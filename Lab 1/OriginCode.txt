Objectives:
1. Set the MCLK to run as close to 25MHz as possible
2. set the core voltage to be set to the max level.

Main Objective:
3.write a program that measures the time between consecutive button presses using
interrupts and ONE of the timers to implement this functionality.

note: it is acceptable to set the breakpoint in order to check the time measurement results
